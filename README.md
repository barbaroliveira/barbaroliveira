## About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Barbara Oliveira, a master's student in Biomedical Engineering with an interest in the intersection of technology and healthcare.

### Academic Journey:

- **Biomedical Engineering:** My projects in C, Java, HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and MySQL.

- **Industrial Management:** Postgraduate studies delving into Visual Basic and SolidWorks.

- **Personal Projects:** Beyond coursework, my projects reflect a curious mind, documented alongside languages learned and other endeavors.

### Thesis Work:

Currently immersed in my thesis, I'm making a Full-stack application for the management of Dental Clinics using React for the front end, NodeJS for the backend, and MySQL for the database.

### Future Pursuits:

I'm eagerly anticipating my upcoming mobility program at St. PÃ¶lten University of Applied Sciences, where I'll delve into artificial intelligence, generative adversarial networks, transformer architectures, and image generation models.

Feel free to explore each project category to learn more about the specific technologies and experiences that have shaped my journey. If you share a passion for technology, healthcare, or innovative solutions, let's connect!
